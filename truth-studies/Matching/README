Shorts:
* Res-Lep: Resonance top decaying leptonically
* Res-Had: Resonance top decaying hadronically
* Spec-Lep: Spectator top decaying leptonically 
* Spec-Had: Spectator top decaying hadronically
* Res: Resonance
* Truth Jets: These are jets that are have no detector inefficiencies applied to them
* Truth Children: These are the immediate decay particles from the truth top. These have not emitted any gluon radiation if they are Quarks.
* Based on TRUTH CHILDREN!: There are two ways of determining whether a top decays leptonically, one being top.Lepton or [ if lepton in top.Children ]. These methods DO NOT necessarily produce the same outcome, .Lepton is the matched DETECTOR lepton to the top.Children. So if a DETECTOR lepton is missing, tops actually decaying leptonically will NOT be considered as such.

-> Figure 1.1:
a: Number of hadronic and leptonically decaying resonance tops (a resonance is classified as hadronic if all tops decay hadronically)
b: Decay channels of the tops, this is an extension of figure a.
c: Mass of Resonance from truth tops - Split into whether the top decays leptonically and hadronically (Top decay channel shouldnt impact the mass, but just to be sure)
d: DeltaR between process truth tops  (Here we check whether the specatator tops are separated from resonance tops)
e: PT Distribution of tops 
f: Energy Distribution of tops

-> Figure 2.1:
a: PDGID of Top Decay products
b: Reconstructed Invariant Top Mass from Children - Divided into Leptonic and Hadronic decay channels
c: Reconstructed Invariant Mass of scalar H resonance - Lep-Lep, Lep-Had, Had-Had
d: DeltaR between children of mutual top (this tests how well the children are clustered) - Split into leptonic and hadronic
e: DeltaR between children and mutual top (tests how much children cluster around the parent top) - Split into leptonic and hadronic
f: DeltaR between adjacent children as a function of parent top PT (we can use this information to see if the resulting jets are possibly merged or produce large-R jets)
g: Fractional Top PT distribution transferred to children - Split by PDGID
f: Invariant mass calculation difference between using Cython and PyTorch

-> Figure 3.1:
a: PDGID of Truth Jet parton contributions - These are derived from the GhostPartons that define the truth jet
b: Fraction of parton PT contribution to truth jet
c: DeltaR between parton contributions and truth jet axis
d: Truth Jet PT classified into from top or background
e: Inefficiency of truth jet parton matching based on truth child PDGID (This is based on the truth partons contained in the truth jet.). 
- To elaborate further what this plot tries to demonstrate, it is the percentage lost of each child type. 
- This is calculated by counting the respective top child pdgid and taking the ratio when using truth jet partons matched to the top child. 
- For example; (truth) t -> b + q + qbar this should yield in an ideal world 1 b and 2 q's but from the truth jet partons, this list might only contain b + q, meaning all 'b' were collected, but one of the q's has been lost. 
- A plot of this would therefore have b (0%) and q (50%) (due to the lost qbar). 
f: Reconstructed Invariant Top Mass from Truth Jets - Split into Lepton (+ using the neutrino from truth children - Just to double check that the jets are consistent) and hadronic
g: Z-Prime from Had-Had, Had-Lep, Lep-Lep (again including neutrino)

h: Counting merged truth jets from Signal and Spectator tops. 
i: DeltaR Distribution between truth jets originating from the same truth top. This assumed NO Truth Jets shared different tops.
j: DeltaR Distribution between truth jets originating from different truth tops. This assumed NO Truth Jets shared different tops.


#-----\/ --- needs reworking
-> Figure 4: (x) Not Complete yet.... Jets
+Do as above but add deltaR between jet and truth jet 

-> Figure 5: (x) Not Complete yet....
+ Do Bruce Analysis.
+ Selection criteria:
~> Leptonic t: This is spectator 1
~> 2 Hardest b-tagged jets: these correspond to the Z' daughter tops
~> attach two other jets to each <somehow> (I use deltaR)
~> You now have the Z' -> ttbar daughters
~> Remaining jets are your 2nd spectators 
~> Form M(Z')
~> Fit fit M(Z')
